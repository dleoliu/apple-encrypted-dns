# Encrypted DNS Profiles for Apple Devices

Encrypted DNS profiles for Apple devices running iOS 14+ and macOS 11+.

**Chinese and Japanese versions of README are being developed.**

## How to use

Download the profile and simply install it on your Apple device to use it.

- For iPhone / iPad users: Download the profile via **Safari** or store it in your **File App's root directory** to install it.
- For Mac users: Download the profile and double-click to install it. 

**NOTICE for Mac users:** If you're using anti-malware or anti-adware software which controls your traffic on your Mac, like Norton or AdGuard, using a DNS profile may cause instability in your network connection. If you can't use your network normally after installing the DNS profile, please remove it from your Mac and use an alternative method to configure the DNS server.

I've set different UUID for each profile so it's possible to install all the profiles on your device.
